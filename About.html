<p>our drive in cinema lets our auidence enjoy popular films from the comfort of their car which is perfect for social distancing</p>

<h1>Sounds and screens</h1>
<p>The Luna Drive-In utilises state of the art cinema equipment, combining the highest definition outdoor LED screens and high-grade digital projectors offering full HD picture quality with an incredible wireless transmission of sound straight into the vehicle, to produce an exceptional cinematic experience. 

  We are now the UK’s largest provider of mobile outdoor cinema equipment and our drive-in packages are becoming increasingly popular. You organise the event, sell the tickets and we then turn up with the screen, projector and sound system as well as a technician to operate all the equipment for you.

 

We run both Bluetooth and FM systems but highly recommend the Bluetooth system as it doesn’t not require a license to use. This saves you a significant amount of time applying for a license and filling out the paperwork as well as over £1000 in licensing fees. </p>
